## Technical Architecture

The Installer Mobile App will be built using:

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context API for local state
- **Backend**: Existing Convex backend (shared with web app)
- **Authentication**: Clerk (shared with web app)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data, Expo SecureStore for sensitive information
- **Offline Support**: React Query's caching with custom persistence layer
- **Navigation**: Expo Router for file-based navigation
- **UI Components**: React Native Paper or custom components with consistent styling

## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Development**: Build and test features incrementally
2. **User-Centered Design**: Focus on technician workflows and field usability
3. **Performance First**: Ensure the app performs well on various devices and network conditions
4. **Offline-First**: Design all features to work offline with seamless synchronization
5. **Reuse Backend**: Leverage existing Convex backend to minimize duplication

## Timeline Summary

- **MVP Development**: 12 weeks (Phases 1-5)
- **Beta Testing**: 2 weeks (included in Phase 5)
- **Initial Release**: After successful completion of Phase 5
- **Feature Enhancements**: Ongoing post-MVP release

## Success Metrics

The success of the Installer Mobile App will be measured by:

1. **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of technicians actively using the app
2. **Time Savings**: Reduction in administrative time per job
3. **Data Quality**: Improvement in documentation completeness and accuracy
4. **Customer Satisfaction**: Improvement in customer ratings and feedback
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduction in job completion time and paperwork errors

## Notes

- To mark an item as complete, change `[ ]` to `[x]` in the markdown file
- Each phase should be fully tested before moving to the next phase
- Regular feedback should be collected from technicians throughout development
- Focus on reliability and ease of use over feature richness for the MVP
