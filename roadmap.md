2. **Integration Testing**: Tests for interactions between components
3. **Manual Testing**: Hands-on testing of UI and workflows
4. **Checkpoint Reviews**: Review completion of each phase before proceeding
5. **Continuous Integration**: Automated build and test process
6. **Staging Environment**: Test in a production-like environment before deployment

## Notes

- To mark an item as complete, change `[ ]` to `[x]` in the markdown file
- Each phase should be fully tested before moving to the next phase
- Regular progress reviews should be conducted to identify and address any issues early
